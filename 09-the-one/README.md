Style #9
==============================

Constraints:

- Existence of an abstraction to which values can be
converted. 

- This abstraction provides operations to (1) wrap
around values, so that they become the abstraction; (2) bind
itself to functions, so to establish sequences of functions;
and (3) unwrap the value, so to examine the final result.

- Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions bound
together, with unwrapping happening at the end.


Possible names:

- The One
- Monadic Identity
- The wrapper of all things
- Imperative functional style
